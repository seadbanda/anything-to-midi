The Hardware and associated firmware/drivers/software to allow users to build there own midi controller out of any sort of keys, switches, dials, or anything else one chooses.
The hardware is based around an STM32 ARM Cortex M3 microcontroller from ST microelectronics. It uses an external USB interface to simplify USB integration.
The hardware can be used to control external midi devices, or connected to a computer via Midi or USB.
There are 14 Input channels used for on/off, velocity coded signals, or analogue signals. They can also be used in a matrix to make 196 on/off inputs or 98 velocity coded signals.
